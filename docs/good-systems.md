> The word system here means anything that helps you get from A to B. It might be a whole software, or just a single module of it. It might be how you organize your notes, thoughts or decisions. It might be how you operate your team.

- systems must be as passive enough as possible.
  - They should require the least maintenance and the least action as possible to achieve their objectives
  - "set and forget"

- systems must be as decentralized as possible
  - they must allow you to change other systems without breaking
  - systems must be as much isolated as possible from other systems

- embrace chaos. your systems must work alongside chaos
  - there are unlimited variables that you can't control
  - these variables are always changing

- systems must not force you to remember anything, and they must not force you to check or do something before using or changing them

- systems must allow you to experiment freely, quickly and easily. They must allow you to explore, discover and learn without breaking anything irreversibly

Bottom-line: good systems are systems you don't notice working. good systems are systems that allow you to explore and spend time thinking about the bigger picture
